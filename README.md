## Lab 6 Authentication

For Lab 6, I had to implement a way for users to create their account, sign in to it, and use it to access unauthorized routes.

## Approach & Efficiency

I have correctly set up the signin and signup routes to create a model and return a user's model with correct authentication, respectively. In future labs this will become much better thought out, as I will be switching to using generated auth tokens from the signin route.
